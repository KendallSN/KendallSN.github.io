            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hi! I'm a passionate Software Engineer who thrives on learning something new every day.
             Whether it's mastering a new framework, optimizing code, or exploring the latest tech trends,
              I'm always looking to expand my skills and improve as a developer. 
            When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing games—on PC, console, or even mobile.
             I enjoy analyzing game mechanics, exploring different platforms, and sometimes even diving into game development myself.
            I love tackling challenges, solving problems, and building efficient, scalable solutions.

                    <p>
                        In this role, I played a key part in developing a dynamic e-commerce platform, integrating a secure payment gateway, user authentication, and product management system. I worked on both the front-end using React.js for an intuitive UI and the back-end using Node.js and Express.js, ensuring seamless performance. Optimizing the database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) and implementing caching strategies significantly improved load times. Additionally, I collaborated with designers and stakeholders to enhance the UX/UI, leading to a more engaging and efficient shopping experience for users.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I contributed to building a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that allowed businesses to automate workflows and manage data efficiently. Using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, I developed an interactive dashboard with real-time analytics. On the backend, I implemented RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints with Django and PostgreSQL, ensuring high scalability. Integrating CI/CD pipelines and Dockerized deployments improved the reliability and maintainability of the application. The project required close collaboration with a cross-functional team, emphasizing Agile methodologies to deliver iterative improvements.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As part of a team developing a social media platform, I built features like real-time messaging, user authentication (OAuth, JWT), and content sharing. The project was developed with Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) to improve SEO and performance, while the backend used Spring Boot and MySQL for secure data storage. I implemented WebSockets for real-time notifications and chat functionality, creating a more engaging user experience. Security best practices, such as data encryption and role-based access control, were a priority to protect user privacy.                    </p>
